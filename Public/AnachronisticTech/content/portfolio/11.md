# Plannerboard

Plannerboard is a to-do list web app backed by PHP built as part of a University course on web development. The app itself is not as fully featured as other to-do lists out there, but I keep it around because it's a convenient way of passing reminders across devices, and I think the Post-It inspired design is cooler than other apps.
