# MiniCities

MiniCities is a one/two-player 2D game built in Swift using SpriteKit for a University of Warwick GameJam on the theme of "mini". The game was built in 48 hours, and was a team collaboration between me on programming, and my mum on artwork. The game involves players driving around in Minis to collect points in different cities to beat their opponent.
