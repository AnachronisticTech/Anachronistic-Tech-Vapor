# The Mirror

The Mirror is a two-player proof-of-concept game built in Unreal Engine 4 for a University of Warwick GameJam on the theme of "reflection". The game involves two players cooperating to solve puzzles in a split-screen mirrored environment. The puzzles are physics/parkour-based, and the players are separated by a mirror, meaning cooperation is accomplished using reflections. Both players must reach the end together to finish the game.
