# Anachronistic Tech Website

The Anachronistic Tech website is my personal journal and showcase space on the internet. Powered by Vapor and built with hand-crafted styles and themes, this site is as much a representation of my passion as it is a window into my thoughts, projects, and inspirations. Here, you can find out about the projects I'm working on, the technologies I'm using, the ideas I come up with, and the stories that accompany them all.
