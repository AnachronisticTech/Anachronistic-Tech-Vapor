# Star Trek Database

The STO Database is a web app built to track characters in Star Trek Online. The app features sections for managing captains, their crew, biographies, media, assets, and game progress. Additionally, privacy settings are included to allow users to share or restrict view privileges. *NOTE:* The app is built in PHP, and is currently in a long process of being redesigned. Some features have been disabled, but the app is still otherwise online and available.
