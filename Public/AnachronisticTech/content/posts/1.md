summary: I’ve spent a lot of time this summer throwing cars around bends and timing my reactions and lap times as carefully and precisely as possibly in Sony’s flagship racing title. Not only that, I’ve found a way to bond with my dad through gaming.

# What have I been playing this summer? – Gran Turismo Sport (PS4, 2017)

For the non racing aficionados, Gran Turismo is the Sony PlayStation’s premier racing title. Since its first release in 1997 (incidentally, my year of birth), Gran Turismo has been developed by Polyphony Digital as a Sony exclusive car racing game which prides itself on its stunning visual realism. Over its numerous iterations the game has included countless different racing cars and tracks, most being accurate to their real-world counterparts – even down to the tiny details of the bodywork and the sound of the engine revolutions, and the natural surroundings and manmade structures found surrounding the numerous circuits.
To provide a little bit of context, I’m not much into cars. Though I’ve had a license and been able to drive for around two years now, I’m not a car buff beyond knowing the different brands out there. Equally, I’m not that into racing games. At least, I wasn’t until I found a cheap copy of the latest Gran Turismo at a second-hand game shop just before university ended for the summer; while I wasn’t much of a racer, I knew my dad loves watching Formula 1 and quite enjoyed the previous games, so I bought him the latest title as an early birthday gift.

In the past, whenever dad would load up Gran Turismo, he’d ask if I wanted to take on a race. For sixteen-year-old me, that meant accelerate the car as fast as physics would allow and worry about bends after smacking into a wall. Invariably, I’d end up last, return the controller, and dad would offer me a turn again the following week. This summer, however, things changed: I decided to take the game a little more seriously. I wondered, “what if I paid attention to the guiding line on the track?", “what if I didn’t decorate every hard surface with the front of my car?". Suddenly, the game became challenging and quite entertaining as we progressed from the slower cars to the faster ones. We encountered the odd frustration here and there with difficult races and events, but it was fun to push through, partly for the challenge of beating every track, but mostly because this time dad and I were a team.

Initially – for me, anyway – it was tricky keeping cars on the track. Whether it was a lawnmower or a Mazda roadster that had a top speed of 70mph (because dad prefers miles, and I couldn’t figure out how to switch to metric), I was a pretty awful driver. After a while, though, I started getting the hang of it; learning each car meant I could anticipate when and how much to brake, repeating each track until we’d beaten it taught me each bend and how to approach it. Before long, dad and I had stomped through the Beginner and Amateur Leagues, raking in money and mileage points (the currency used to upgrade vehicles). Like in real life, a driver can tune, or modify, aspects of their car to suit their style or the needs of the track. As I mentioned earlier, I’m not very knowledgeable or passionate about cars, so the tuning system of GT Sport – where the car is tuned by changing different values like gear ratios and ride height – was quite appealing to me in its simplicity.

Before I was consistently beating races in the Amateur section of the campaign, I was convinced that the AI opponents played by the console were tuning their cars for each race. After all, if the player has that capability, why not the AI? Being the useless driver I was at the start, I couldn’t believe that the AI was so good that it would finish fifteen to twenty seconds ahead of me; it must have had some advantage. So, in the early days, dad and I would spend ten minutes before a race tuning and tweaking, trying to eke out a little more performance for the in-game money we had spent on the car. After a while, though, it became clear to both of us that winning the race came down to skill, and that we could beat the AI (which we have since concluded use untuned cars) if we practiced and went through each bend as well as possible. Slowly, we started tuning less and less, relying now on our knowledge of the tracks and the capabilities of the cars to propel us into first place; eventually we stopped tuning altogether. Together, dad and I spurred each other on to try again if we didn’t win, which I don’t think I could stay as motivated for on my own, especially in a genre of gaming that isn’t in my comfort zone.

After about a month and a half spent beating the Beginner and Amateur Leagues into submission, dad and I entered the Professional League, the penultimate league of the campaign. This section catered to faster cars like Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and even fully-fledged Formula 1 cars from Mercedes. Despite our earlier revelations about skill and tuning, we found that we couldn’t beat the AI in this league without a few alterations to the cars, but for the most part, we limited our modifications to traction control and weight reduction – we still wanted to win using skill, after all. The races in this league took us longer to beat, but as before, we persevered through the Ferrari-only and Lamborghini-only events and were confident we’d get to the final league before the end of the summer break. Then we came to the event of the F1500T-A car, and that house of cards thoroughly collapsed…

![The infamous F1500T-A](f1500.jpg)

The F1500T-A is a fictional Formula One-style car, apparently based on F1 cars of the 1980s; the F1500T-A is smaller, lighter, and ultimately less powerful than its real-life modern equivalent, but it was still an entirely different beast to the other cars we’d encountered thus far. Most of the previous cars we’d used were road legal – you could potentially see these driving around town. However, like actual F1 cars, the F1500 (as it is usually shortened) would not be road-legal. Essentially, it’s more of a vehicular contraption designed to move quickly, brake at a moment’s notice, and win things. What made this car even trickier to use – as was later explained to me by a friend – the F1500 has a turbo mechanism, meaning once the engine reaches a certain point as the car accelerates, the car will accelerate much faster than normal (apologies to the car people here – I know I’ve butchered that explanation, but it’s not really the point). The takeaway from this is that if you don’t know the car – or aren’t paying enough attention – you may find yourself barrelling into a wall because the car accelerated quicker than you could slow down. To add to the problems, the F1500 tended to slip from its rear weight when moving through bends, so between the traction control mechanics, losing the back of the car, and generally trying to manoeuvre the thing at 100mph, you’d be having a pretty rough time of it wherever you were racing.

As if the car weren’t bad enough, most of the five tracks in this event were also quite nasty. Some tracks, like the famed Nürburgring Grand Prix circuit (8 laps) and the Autodromo Nazionale Monza (10 laps) were relatively easy to beat; despite containing some nasty chicanes and bend sequences, neither track had a killer feature that could ruin a lap. Only the two chicanes in the Monza track needed a bit of care and forethought. Similarly, Autodromo De Interlagos (10 laps) was not too difficult; only a set of bends around two thirds of the way through a lap required some calculated braking, otherwise you would end up in the dirt. Despite this, the bends were easy to recover from, so I wouldn’t label them a killer feature that could derail an entire attempt. The two races that caused inordinate amounts of headache, though, were Brands Hatch (10 laps) and the Suzuka Circuit (10 laps) which has appeared in every Gran Turismo game since its fourth release.

What differentiates Brands Hatch and Suzuka from the other three tracks, I think, is their combination of killer features with wide bends and long straight sections also. For example, Suzuka has a few sequences of bends leading into each other followed by or preceded by straight sections that allow you to catch up to the lead car quite quickly. However, Suzuka also has a chicane, like Monza, which requires a great deal of care: decelerating too late will send you racing into a wall, decelerating too early will lose you a lot of time and most likely lead to your being overtaken or smashed into from the back, and the chicane will take forever to traverse anyway. However, braking at the correct point allows you to move through the two bends quickly, and the last bend deposits you in a perfect position from which you can accelerate safely and quickly away. Both Suzuka and Brands Hatch also have a tight hairpin bend – essentially a U-turn in the circuit – which must be handled like the chicane or the same sequence of events occurs.

Even after weeks cracking away at Suzuka and Brands Hatch, neither dad nor I could reach first place for any useful length of time per race. We started each race at sixteenth of sixteen, and worked our way to thirteenth, then tenth, ninth, fifth, third. Then our progress hit a wall. Turn after turn, lap after lap, we continued to chip away – primarily at Suzuka – though as our frustration increased with each attempt, our patience thinned. We decided to set the game down for around two weeks, then pick it up after our annual holiday trip abroad. We returned refreshed and re-motivated to win, but the game wouldn’t give. What was worse, since both circuits were ten laps each – with each lap taking one to two minutes – they required a lot of concentration and consistency. A single spin off the track on the eighth lap would instantly render the previous ten minutes of work pointless.

I was prepared to give up. While it felt rubbish admitting defeat, I reminded myself how much I disliked Suzuka regardless of the car. On the other hand, this was dad’s favourite track, and he was determined to push through and win. After taking a break for a few days, I was reluctantly convinced to try again, though I vividly remember how the fun was no longer there as I took the controller and prepared for another run. The race felt just like any of the previous hundred attempts, and there were a few moments where I was certain I would spin, and the race would be another failure. I kept expecting to lose the back of the car as I rounded each bend, and mentally prepared myself to throw my arms up in exasperation as the car in first drove out of view and all the fourteen cars behind me sailed past as I watched from the curb. Despite all the negative feelings, though, the moment never arrived; I caught up to the car in first by the seventh lap – which, by this point, was not unexpected – and overtook it about half a lap later. This was usually the point where everything would go sideways, and the race and my motivation would be equally lost, but this time I managed to hold onto the lead. I finished the race in first only 0.2 seconds ahead of the next car; not a comfortable margin, but one I would settle for if it meant the ordeal was over. 

Several days later, not only did I add Brands Hatch to the list of completed races, I won the same Suzuka race twice more. Like Suzuka previously, Brands Hatch was another struggle to beat, but not one that took weeks of practice and frustration. What was more surprising, however, was that I had defeated Suzuka twice that same day also, and by just how much I had beaten it in the following attempts. I finished seven and ten seconds ahead of the next car in the first and second tries respectively, but what struck me most was how poorly I felt the middle race went. Objectively speaking, the first win at Suzuka was as perfect a race as I could perform with consistently low lap times and hardly any mistakes, yet I finished only a fraction of a second ahead. The second win, however, had laps with times that varied significantly, and I even made several mistakes and slips, yet I finished with around seven seconds to spare. My theory for the difference is that by the time I returned for the second and third tries, Suzuka was no longer “unwinnable"; I had already beaten it once, so I could do it again. While the first race was full of tension and well-deserved relief at winning, the second was mostly a “don’t care" reaction: “If I win, I win. If I lose, I’ve already beaten it once anyway."

Despite the frustration, difficulty, and loss of motivation I felt toward the end of the summer and our Gran Turismo playthrough, I do feel I’ve improved at racing games and learned a bit about cars too. The most important outcome, though, is that my dad and I have grown a little closer for having spent as much time as we did chipping away at something we were both interested in. Granted, though my interest in racing games mainly developed recently as opposed to dad’s long-time love of racing in general, it was rewarding to bond over a shared experience and a shared sense of struggle and improvement. I think I’ll remember for a long time the proud look on dad’s face when I finally beat Suzuka in the F1500T-A after weeks of practice. I imagine it’s the same look he would have had if I’d learned to ride a bicycle when he tried to teach me all those years ago…
