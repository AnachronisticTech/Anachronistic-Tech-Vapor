summary: Storytelling, for me, is one of the things that makes life interesting and vibrant; each story has a message or an idea that is presented in a wrapper meant to be appealing and enticing. I love listening to and telling stories, both real-world and fictional. However, I’m not a writer by trade, so when it comes to fictional tales I often find myself looking beyond words to express myself.

# Thoughts and Diet Cola – Creativity

Those who know me – or have read my blog – will probably know I’m a massive Star Trek fan. I love the stories, the characters, the setting. As storytelling and commentary goes, I think Star Trek is quite hard to beat; whether tackling issues relating to politics, society, war, interpersonal, or moral, Star Trek has great episodes and films addressing each in its own subtle but still entertaining way. It’s the feature of good science fiction, I believe, that stories of this genre approach sensitive or controversial topics in a way that addresses the issue but is also entertaining for the audience.

Of late, I’ve not been able to re-watch as much Trek as I used to (rubbish coursework…), but I’ve found more time to expand my horizons into the expanded universe of Trek in the form of novels and short stories. Some of these focus on characters from film and television, continuing or expanding their adventures past the limit of what is (or was at the time) feasible on an episodic budget and 90s era special effects. Others follow different characters entirely; while many are completely new characters, others may be one-off extras from that one scene in that episode… you know the one. Regardless, following a new crew on new adventures gives the authors a remarkable amount of flexibility in storytelling and character development while still fitting within a defined but growing universe.

A massively multiplayer online game attempted to capture this idea of following the crew of the player through the Trek universe back in 2009-10, Star Trek Online. As of writing this in December 2018, it’s still going, and it’s one of my favourite games. Partly this is because the stories told through the game are on par in terms of writing with the original television series, but mostly it’s because of the build-your-own-crew approach. The player has complete control over everything to do with everything about their character and crew-mates: species, gender, appearance, skills, profession, and the vessel they all serve on. This isn’t meant to be a game review – though I may decide to post a review in the future – but rather an introduction. As a gamer, I created characters to play the game. As a creator, however, I put special effort into a single character as part of an experiment: to create my own Trek-style crew and adventures to stretch my creativity.

While I’m not yet ready to go into details as to what the story is about, I will say that most of my time spent writing fiction is devoted to this crew and their experiences in the Trek universe. Not being a writer, however, makes constant planning and writing a little difficult; I’m not an expert in literary devices, the use of themes and motifs, etc., so in addition to writing, I also look for other avenues of expression.

Complementary to the main game, Star Trek Online includes a recording feature that allows a player to record a session then playback and edit that session. You can remove visual effects, alter camera angles and field of view, and even replace character and ship models from other recordings. Armed with this and a decent photo editing suite, I moved into creating stills of my characters and ships, and I began publishing to DeviantArt in the summer of 2017. As university work began to build up, I put my artwork on hold to focus on studying but have come back to it over the last month as I was inspired by some of the art I saw at the recent Trek convention in Birmingham. Below are a couple of my most recent attempts, and the full gallery can be found [here](https://www.deviantart.com/iwillcomply).

Using the recorder’s in-built camera path editor and some open-source video editing software called [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/), I even took a stab at creating what I imagined an intro credits sequence might look like if my fiction ever made it to the silver screen…
